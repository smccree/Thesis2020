## Eighty-Six Moon Road: A Participatory Narrative Walking Simulator Game
This is an ongoing project, set to be completed in spring 2020.

In Eighty-Six Moon Road, the player has just moved into a new house. One morning, they wake up to a mysterious voice calling out to them, and find an old key to the abandoned house across the street. They're tasked with exploring the house at 86 Moon Road and helping the ghost that once lived there to remember what happened to them, and why the house has become abandoned.

### Project Goals:
1. Tell a cohesive and moving story using environmental storytelling in the walking simulator format
2. Allow the player to use their natural language in composing conversations with the mysterious ghost
3. Implement an AI system that allows the ghost to respond in a way that makes sense based on player input

### Project Specs:
This game is being built in Unity 3D with a majority of assets sourced from the Unity Asset store. Code is written in Visual Studio C#.
