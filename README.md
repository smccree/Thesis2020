## Eighty-Six Moon Road: A Participatory Narrative Walking Simulator Game
This is an ongoing project, set to be completed in spring 2020.

In Eighty-Six Moon Road, the player embodies the role of Eliza Beale, a young woman who returns early from a trip to Paris, to her home at Beale Terrace, 86 Moon Road, London in the year 1881. When she arrives at the house, she finds out that her friend and former house guest, Rebecca Stearn, is now haunting the premises. Together they explore the house for clues to unlock Rebecca's jumbled memories of her fate, and put together all the pieces that led to her tragic passing.

### Project Goals:
1. Tell a cohesive and moving story using environmental storytelling in the walking simulator format
2. Allow the player to type their dialogue responses into a keyboard as user-generated text 
3. Implement an AI system that allows the ghost to respond in a way that makes sense based on player input
